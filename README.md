# Muh
🐮 Muh is a Java Application written with JavaFX and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision), who has the ability to detect patterns/objects on Pictures (🖼/📷) and Videos (📀/📹), that can be chosen by the user. 🐮

The Plan is to make it a cool & easily useable application for people who work in the forest or with animals and want an app to spectate these and analyse the data, it would make it much easier to detect the parts of the video where an animal appears, these videos are usually more than >8 Hours long. 🐮
